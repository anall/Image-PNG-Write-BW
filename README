NAME

    Image::PNG::Write::BW - Create minimal black-and-white PNG files.

VERSION

    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS

    This is a pure-perl module to encode a variety of raw black-and-white
    (1bpp) image representations into a minimal PNG file.

        use Image::PNG::Write::BW qw( make_png_string );
    
        my $data = make_png_string( [ "# ", " #" ] ); # Returns a 2x2 repeatalbe grid pattern.

EXPORT

 make_png_string( \@lines )

    Takes an arrayref of strings and turns them into a PNG. Whitespace
    characters are white, non-whitespace are black.

    For example: make_png_string( [ "###", "# #", "###" ] ) will make a 3x3
    box with a hole in the middle.

 make_png_bitstream_array( \@scanlines, $width )

    One bit per pixel, left-to-right on the image is high-bit to low-bit,
    lowest index to highest index. Each scanline passed as a seperate array
    element.

    This currently copies each scanline.

 make_png_bitstream_packed( $scanlines, $width, $height );

    One bit per pixel, left-to-right on the image is high-bit to low-bit,
    lowest index to highest index. Each scanline starting on a byte
    boundary, with all scanlines packed into the same string.

    This is the closest to the "native" PNG format.

    This currently copies each scanline. If you have the ability to use the
    raw format ( prefix each line with \0 ), the make_png_bitstream_raw
    method may be more efficient.

 make_png_bitstream_raw( $data, $width, $height );

    This is the "native" format that PNG uses: One bit per pixel,
    left-to-right on the image is high-bit to low-bit, lowest index to
    highest index.

    Each scanline starting on a byte boundary, with all scanlines packed
    into the same string.

    Every scanline must be prefixed by the filter type (which should be \0,
    unless you know what you are doing.)
